# Building a SQL Database

In this project, my goal is to create a new SQL database using MySQL and Sequel Ace while delving into the fundamental concepts of primary keys, foreign keys, and best practices for Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). To make the learning experience more engaging and practical, I have chosen to create a database specifically for the Pokemon Trading Card Game. By using this popular game as an example, I aim to provide a concrete context for understanding and implementing these important database concepts.

Key objecyives include ; scraping information from a specific website, define the tables and their relationships, and establish a connection between the SQL database and Python for data storage and querying.

## Introduction
In this project, we explore the process of creating an SQL database while documenting the learning journey. The focus is on scraping information from a specific website and using that data to build tables with defined relationships. Additionally, we establish a connection between the SQL database and Python to facilitate data storage and querying.

## Scraping Information
The first step of this project involved scraping information from the website [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page). The target was to retrieve specific data that would be stored in the SQL database. By using web scraping techniques, relevant information was extracted from the website to serve as the foundation for the database.

## Table Creation and Relationship Definition
Once the necessary data was scraped, the next step was to create tables in SQL. The SQL language was employed to design and define the tables required for storing the scraped information. Relationships between the tables were established to represent the connections and dependencies between different entities within the database. This step involved careful consideration of the data structure and design to ensure optimal organization and efficiency.

## Connecting SQL Database to Python
To integrate the SQL database with Python, a connection needed to be established between the two. The Jupyter Notebook environment was utilized to facilitate this connection. Python scripts were written to connect to the SQL database and enable the transfer of data from the scraped information. Queries were executed within the notebook, allowing for seamless interaction with the SQL database and retrieval of desired information.

## Conclusion
This project aimed to document the learning process and creation of an SQL database. By scraping data from a specific website, defining table relationships, and connecting the SQL database to Python, a comprehensive understanding of the database creation process was achieved. This README provides an overview of the project's key points and serves as a guide for anyone interested in exploring the steps taken to learn and create an SQL database.
